# Analysis of Used Car Prices

This repository contains the results of the analysis and forecasting of prices for used cars based on the dataset "Used Car Auction Prices" from Kaggle. The dataset was compiled in 2015 and provides valuable information for understanding the dynamics of the used car market.

## Project Objective

The aim of this analysis was to investigate the factors influencing the prices of used cars, as well as to develop models for price forecasting based on available characteristics.

## Findings

The analysis revealed that both linear regression and random forest models demonstrated strong performance. Despite the mean absolute error (MAE) being lower for linear regression, a more significant overall quality indicator (R2) was observed for the random forest model. Thus, the random forest model proved to be the better choice for predicting prices of used cars.

## Future Perspectives

Further research in this area could involve expanding the dataset to include current data, as well as conducting in-depth analysis of the impact of various factors on used car prices using more advanced machine learning models.
